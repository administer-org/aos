### What is it?

This is the underlying app server for Administer. It's a simple FastAPI Python program which manages JSONs essentially. It does not store RBXM files. 

**More TODO**


## Privacy

Administer is made by very privacy conscious people. We only collect the data we need to operate and it is never read by anybody besides the system.

All data is stored in an internal MongoDB Instance. It is not read, shared, sold, or tampered with by Administer staff. For instance, you can expect us to not be like [mark zuckerburg.](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/mark-zuckerberg-called-early-facebook-users-dumb-f-s-for-sharing-data-giving-up-privacy-1195396-2018-03-22)

All we keep on you is your place ID and the apps you install. This is to allow for the rating system.

If you attempt to abuse our API by making fake places, acting as if you are a game server to the API, or any other way you can abuse it, we will log the request. This is for platform safety. We will store the timestamp, some basic IP info (country, ISP, IP, proxy info, state/region), attempted Roblox-Id, and the User-Agent. Abuse of the service will result in permanent blockage. Unless it was 100% a mistake we will not remove you. Realistically this isn't an issue because the API should not be used outside of Roblox servers (IP not collected). We don't collect this data unless you attempt to forge a fake request, so stay out of trouble and nothing bad happens. Win-win.

If you falsely recieved a "This incident will be reported" message and don't believe you did anything wrong, please tell me so I can remove you from our logs.
